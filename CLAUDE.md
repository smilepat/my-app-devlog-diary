# Project Instructions for Claude Code

- Always keep outputs beginner-friendly.
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones.
- Main workflow:
  1) Read docs/dev-log.md
  2) Fill docs/prd-template.md
  3) Write docs/PRD.md
- Never delete dev-log entries.
- If info is missing, write "정보 부족" and suggest what to log next.
